# Foreground
Foreground is an easy to use task manager app. Designed to be beautiful, simple and unintrusive, Foreground helps you know what needs done, and then it gets out of the way.

Currently, Foreground is a beta. Certain features (namely Taskwarrior sync) are not yet complete, and small bugs may be found elsewhere. You can find Foreground on the Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bgregos.brighttask

More info to come!
